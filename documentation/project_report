Fetal Health Classification: A Statistical Analysis of CTG Data
🏥 Executive Summary
The reduction of child and maternal mortality is a key United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. This project utilizes Cardiotocogram (CTG) data to classify fetal health into three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological. Using SAS Studio, I developed a predictive framework that achieves a high discriminatory power (AUC = 0.931) to assist healthcare professionals in early intervention.

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 2,126 records of features extracted from CTG exams.

Target Classes: Normal (77.85%), Suspect (13.88%), and Pathological (8.28%).

Key Features: Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR), Accelerations, Fetal Movement, and various heart rate variability metrics.

🛠 Statistical Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using PROC MEANS and PROC SGPLOT, several critical clinical patterns were identified:

Accelerations: Pathological cases showed an order of magnitude lower mean acceleration (0.0003) compared to Normal cases (0.0039).

Baseline Heart Rate: The "Suspect" class exhibited a higher median FHR (~142 bpm) than both Normal and Pathological classes, suggesting tachycardia as a key suspect marker.

2. Modeling Techniques
Binary Logistic Regression: Modeled "Normal" vs. "Abnormal" (Suspect/Pathological) to prioritize clinical screening.

Multinomial Logistic Regression: Applied a Cumulative Logit model to differentiate between all three health states.

Variable Selection: Utilized SELECTION=STEPWISE (SLS=0.05) to identify the most parsimonious model.

📈 Key Results
Model Performance
The final model, refined through stepwise selection, demonstrated excellent performance:

C-Statistic (AUC): 0.931.

Hosmer-Lemeshow Test: p=0.1112, indicating a good fit where predicted frequencies match observed data.

Specificity: 92.75%, showing strong capability in identifying healthy fetuses.

Sensitivity: 54.35%. Note: While the AUC is high, this highlights a clinical trade-off where the threshold may need adjustment to catch more at-risk cases.

Variable Importance
The Stepwise procedure identified the following hierarchy of predictors:

Accelerations (Most Significant)

Prolonged Decelerations

Uterine Contractions

Baseline Fetal Heart Rate

🔍 Advanced Diagnostics
As part of the statistical validation, Influence Diagnostics were performed:

Pearson Residuals: Identified specific outliers where pathological cases were misclassified.

Leverage (Hat Matrix): Detected influential observations (e.g., Case #1500) that significantly affected parameter estimates.

🚀 Clinical Impact & Conclusion
By automating the classification of CTG data, this solution enables:

Objective Assessment: Reducing variability between different obstetricians’ interpretations.

Resource Prioritization: Focused monitoring for the "Suspect" and "Pathological" classes.

Mortality Reduction: Facilitating timely interventions in low-resource settings where preventable deaths are highest.
